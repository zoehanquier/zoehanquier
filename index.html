<p id="atw2">I walked through the door with you<br> The air was cold. <br> But something 'bout it felt like home somehow <br> And I left my scarf there at your sister's house <br> And you still got it in your drawer even now. </p>
  <p id="clean1"> Clean </p>
<p id="clean2"> The drought was the very worst <br>
(Oh-oh, oh-oh) <br>
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst</p>
  <p id="iion1"> <u> Is It Over Now? </u> </p>
  <p>
<p id="iion2">Once the flight had flown <br>
With the wilt of the rose <br>
I slept all alone <br>
You still wouldn't go</p>

    <td> This is a fun, new track from <i> 1989 (Taylor's Version) </i> that captures the frustration of a failed relationship. </td>
